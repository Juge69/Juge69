- 👋 Hi, I’m @Juge69
- 👀 I’m interested in Video games, music and programming. I have been playing games for a long time and music really runs in my family. I started with my study for software engeneering this year.
- 🌱 I’m currently in college to get a degree in software developing. For now im mostly practicing html and css, soon i will also start with javascript and other background code types.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything people need help with. For now i will mostly do it to learn more about how others approach issues, but i hope to grow and be able to commit useful changes myself.
- 📫 How to reach me:
- Via Email = julianf.gerrits@gmail.com

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My earliest memories in life consist of playing games... AND I LOVE THE WII U. So many memories of playing Nintendo Land with friends :D
