- 👋 Hi, I’m @Juge69. AKA Julian.
- 👀 I’m interested in Video games, music and programming. I have been playing games for a long time and music really runs in my family. I started with my study for software engeneering in summer of 2024.
- 🌱 I’m currently in college to get a degree in software developing. Im currently experienced in HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. Currently im also gaining experience in how to use WordPress using timber/twig. In my own time im trying to get more experience in python (for now specifically test scripting with the Robot framework ;D). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything people need help with. For now i will mostly do it to learn more about how others approach issues, but i hope to grow and be able to commit useful changes myself. I like a challenge and look forward to learning more or helping with assignments and tasks. For now specifically in Javascript (which im trying to get a certificate for)
